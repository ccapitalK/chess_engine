- [X] Pick best move that is legal from 2-deep search
- [X] Tune tree search, set stopping time

## Interface

- [x] Run in specified time limit

## Board representation

- [X] Random deep tree search
- [ ] (Un)Marshal abstract board state to a specific optimized representation
- [ ] Bitboard
- [ ] Magic Bitboard

## Algos

- [X] Alpha-Beta pruning
- [X] Iterative Deepening
- [ ] Quiescence
- [ ] Transposition tables
- [ ] Reuse the principle variation when deepening
- [ ] Cuda tree search?
