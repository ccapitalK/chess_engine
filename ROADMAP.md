# Roadmap

## Getting started

- [x] Read a move, pick a random (simple) move, write a move
- [x] Enumerate legal moves
- [x] Basic board repr
- [ ] Pick best move that is legal from 2-deep search
- [ ] Tune tree search, set stopping time

## Board representation

- [ ] (Un)Marshal abstract board state to a specific optimized representation
- [ ] Bitboard
- [ ] Random deep tree search

## Algos
- [ ] Alpha-Beta pruning
